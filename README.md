AI-Based Code Review Assistant
📌 Project Overview

The AI-Based Code Review Assistant is an intelligent tool that automatically analyzes code for style consistency, performance bottlenecks, and potential vulnerabilities.
It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models to mimic the behavior of a human code reviewer, ensuring faster and more reliable feedback in software development.

This project is built with Python (Flask) and integrates with GitLab API to fetch Pull Requests (PRs) for automated review.

🚀 Features

✅ Automated Code Review — Identifies style violations, unused imports, and best-practice improvements.

✅ Performance Insights — Flags inefficient loops, redundant operations, and costly function calls.

✅ Security Checks — Detects vulnerable function usage (e.g., eval, insecure SQL queries).

✅ GitLab Integration — Reviews PRs and comments directly on merge requests.

✅ Customizable Rules — Extend or modify code review checks as per project needs.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend: Python, Flask

AI/NLP Models: Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy

Integration: GitLab API

Database (Optional): MongoDB (for storing review history)

Deployment: Docker

⚡ How It Works

Developer pushes code → GitLab CI/CD triggers review.

The assistant fetches the Pull Request code using GitLab API.

AI model analyzes the code for style, performance, and security issues.

Review comments are automatically posted back on the PR.

▶️ Setup & Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-code-review-assistant.git
cd ai-code-review-assistant

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run Locally
python app.py

4️⃣ GitLab Integration

Create a GitLab Personal Access Token with API access.

Add it to your environment variables:

export GITLAB_TOKEN=your_token_here

📊 Example Output

Pull Request Analysis Example:

⚠️ Found unused import: import numpy as np in data_loader.py

🔄 Loop optimization suggested in model.py:45

🔒 Avoid using eval() in utils.py:12

🎯 Future Enhancements

Add support for GitHub PRs

Integrate LLMs for natural language explanations of review feedback

Extend to multiple programming languages (Java, C++, JS)
